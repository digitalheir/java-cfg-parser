/**
 * Iterator for maps of type Object and double.
 *
 * The iterator semantics for Trove's primitive maps is slightly different
 * from those defined in <tt>java.util.Iterator</tt>, but still well within
 * the scope of the pattern, as defined by Gamma, et al.
 *
 * This iterator does <b>not</b> implicitly advance to the next entry when
 * the value at the current position is retrieved.  Rather, you must explicitly
 * ask the iterator to <tt>advance()</tt> and then retrieve either the <tt>key()</tt>,
 * the <tt>value()</tt> or both.  This is done so that you have the option, but not
 * the obligation, to retrieve keys and/or values as your application requires, and
 * without introducing wrapper objects that would carry both.  As the iteration is
 * stateful, access to the key/value parts of the current map entry happens in
 * constant time.
 *
 * In practice, the iterator is akin to a "search finger" that you move from
 * position to position.  Read or write operations affect the current entry only and
 * do not assume responsibility for moving the finger.
